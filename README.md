### House
Real Estate sector is a growing industry in most parts of the world. As a result, necessary to accurately predict the price of a house sales in different years to understand the market trend. One of the techniques of predicting house values is to use data on the characteristics of the houses, geographical location of the houses, and also housing stock to estimate a hedonic regression using machine learning. The coefficients of this regression are then used to produce the predicted house prices. Machine learning techniques, potentially includes, large source of information regarding house pricesâ€”the correlations existing between the prices of neighboring houses. This project uses machine learning algorthim to create house price predictions using labeled data with different house measurements and characteristics.

The data passes through data preprocessing stages and finnaly a house pricing model is saved. 
Further steps, could be deployment of the model to production and expossing the model to unseen data. The productionization of the model requires monitoring and retrainng to maintain the model accuracy and reliability for better results.
